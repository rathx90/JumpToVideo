JumpToVideo
===========

A small Chrome extension that lets you skip directly to the embedded video in a linked page. Only works with iframe embedded youtube videos.


Not too much experience working with javascript or working with Chrome extensions so excuse the crudeness of the code.
Fiarly limited use for now. Only works with iframe-embedded youtube videos but hopefully the scope of this will be increased in the future.
